Please note that in the above code snippet, the `<form action="SaveEntryServlet" method="POST">` attribute `action` is set to `SaveEntryServlet`, which represents the servlet or endpoint responsible for handling the form submission and saving the diary entry into the database. You would need to create the `SaveEntryServlet` and implement the necessary logic to process the form data and store it in the database.
